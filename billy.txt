my fellow brothers I Billy Harrington
0:14
stand here today humbled by the task
0:16
before us mindful of the sacrifices
0:18
borne by our niconico ancestors we are
0:22
in the midst of crisis niconico Douga is
0:25
at war against a far-reaching storm of
0:28
disturbance and deletion Nico Nico's
0:32
economy is badly weakened a consequence
0:34
of carelessness and irresponsibility on
0:36
the part of management but also on the
0:39
collective failure to make hard choices
0:41
and prepare for a new Mad Age today I
0:45
say to you that the challenge is real
0:48
they are serious and they are many
0:50
they will not be easily met or in a
0:53
short span of time
0:54
but know that niconico they will be met
0:57
in reaffirming the greatness of our
1:00
sight
1:01
we understand that greatness is never
1:03
given our journey has never been one of
1:05
shortcuts it has not been for the path
1:08
for the faint-hearted or seek only the
1:11
fleshly pleasures rather it has been the
1:14
risk-takers the wasted genie the
1:16
creators of mad things for us they
1:19
toiled in sweatshops endured the lash of
1:22
the spanking time and time again these
1:25
men struggled and sacrifice so that we
1:28
might live better we remain the most
1:33
powerful sight on the internet and minds
1:36
are no less inventive
1:38
and services are no less needed that
1:40
they were last week or yesterday or the
1:44
day before the day after tomorrow
1:46
starting today we must pull up our pants
1:50
dust ourselves off and begin again the
1:53
work of remaking Nico Nico Douga now
1:57
there are some who question the scale of
1:59
our ambitions who suggest that our
2:01
service system cannot tolerate too many
2:03
movies their memories are short for they
2:06
have forgotten what Nico Nico already
2:09
has done what free men can achieve when
2:12
imagination
2:13
is joined to common purpose and so to
2:18
all the people who are watching this
2:20
video from the grandest cities to the
2:22
small villages where exil was born know
2:25
that niconico is a friend of every man
2:28
who seeks a future of love and peace now
2:33
we will begin to responsibly leave otter
2:35
eyes common materials to niconico people
2:39
and forge a hard-earned peace in this
2:41
mad world what is required of us now is
2:45
a new era of responsibility this is the
2:48
price and the promise of Nikko Nikko
2:50
Mons citizenship nico nico douga
2:53
in the face of all common dangers in
2:56
this winter of our hardship let us
2:58
remember these timeless words as we can
3:02
let it be said by our children's
3:04
children that when we were tested by das
3:06
attacks and refused by YouTube we did
3:09
not turn back nor did we falter and we
3:12
were carried forth that the great gift
3:15
of freedom be delivered and it safely to
3:17
future generations thank you god bless
3:20
and God bless nico nico douga
